#Bootsy

Bootsy provides an organized folder structure for every aspect of a project. It contains versioning & templates folders to help you bootstrap and maintain your project. I also added some tools such as keynote templates, resets, RACI models, reports models for PMs. Also, I only pushed a file with the structure written in indentation.

By the way, I am totally open to suggestions to improve and discuss Bootsy, feel free to post an issue or request a pull request.
